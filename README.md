# Atheoretical
A set of VBA scripts to rapidly produce supervised ML analyses in Excel.

Helpful when you run need to run regressions/supervised ML in Excel on a periodical basis and you want to save yourself some time.

### Notes
- The scripts are given as *.bas* files, which can be imported easily into Excel's VBA console.
- The file is currently limited to clean datasets with quantitative continuous variables.
- Alternatively, the repo contains an Excel document with preloaded scripts and pre-populated (dummy) hyper-parameters, for testing.
- The dataset in this folder is also for testing purposes.

### Pending:
- [ ] Documentation. The Excel file includes guidance, but more detailed documentation would not hurt.
- [ ] Stress testing. The file currently works fully with the sample dataset, but bugs are incredibly likely.
- [ ] Code cleaning. There are still macros that use repeated code sequences.

## Usage/Licensing
I honestly have not thought about this just yet. I *really* do not think the files are yet at production or even pilot-testing level. So, for now, let's say it's all rights reserved.
