# Atheoretical
A set of VBA scripts to rapidly produce supervised (regression-based) ML analyses in Excel. File is currently limited to quantitative continuous variables.

Helpful when you run need to run regressions/supervised ML in Excel on a periodical basis and you want to save yourself some time.

Version -1. Expect bugs. Loads of them.

### Notes
- The *mainFiles* folder contains an Excel document with clear guidance, preloaded scripts, and pre-populated (dummy) hyper-parameters.
- The *mainFiles* folder also contains a dataset that can be used for testing (due credits given in Excel file).
- Theoretically, the file should be able to handle other data files. That's ultimately the goal.

- Additionally, the individual modules/scripts are given as *.bas* files, which can be imported easily into Excel's VBA console.

### Pending:
- [ ] Documentation. The Excel file includes guidance, but more detailed documentation would not hurt.
- [ ] Stress testing. The file currently works fully with the sample dataset, but bugs are incredibly likely.
- [ ] Code cleaning. There are still macros that use repeated code sequences.

## Usage/Licensing
I honestly have not thought about this just yet. I *really* do not think the files are yet at production or even pilot-testing level. So, for now, let's say it's all rights reserved.
